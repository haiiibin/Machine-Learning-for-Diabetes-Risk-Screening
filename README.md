# Early Diabetes Detection using Two-Stage Machine Learning System

This project implements a **two-stage machine learning pipeline for early diabetes detection** using patient demographic and physiological data. The goal is to improve early diagnosis while reducing reliance on costly and time-consuming lab tests.

## 🔬 Project Overview
Early detection of diabetes is critical for preventing long-term complications. However, laboratory testing is expensive and time-intensive. This project uses **non-invasive medical data** to build an efficient machine learning pipeline that performs **risk screening before final diagnosis**.

## ⚙️ Methods & Models
| Stage | Algorithm | Purpose | Performance |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Stage 1 | Logistic Regression | Initial screening | **F1-score = 0.7773** |
| Stage 2 | Random Forest | Final classification | **F1-score = 0.8696** |
